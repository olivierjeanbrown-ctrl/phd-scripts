# Brain Imaging Preprocessing Tools
These are bash scripts for DTI and fMRIPrep image preprocessing.
--- 
Note that there are several dependencies listed in each script (e.g., FSL, AFNI).

Note that some of the directories are hardcoded to the unique local device.
These MUST be modified for the scripts to function properly. As such, these scripts should serve as tempalte examples rather than ready for application.
